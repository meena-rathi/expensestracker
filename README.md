## Introduction ##

I've developed a budget expenses project where users can add their monthly budget and expenses for various products. This allows them to track and identify which products have higher expenses compared to others.

## User Personas ##

- A user can manage their budget and expense.

## User Stories ##

* I have designed the user stories outlined in my [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/meena-rathi/projects/3).
* I followed the agile methodology to implement my project using GitHub Projects.
* Each user story has its own acceptance criteria. 

The user storys in my GitHub project are as follows:

* As a site user, I can easily create an account to access the website.
* As a site user, I can add a monthly budget. 
* As a site user, I can add the expenses.
* As a site user, I can see total amount of expenses substract from the buget.
* As a site User, I can edit and delete the expenses.
* As a site User, I can expeses in the pie chart.
